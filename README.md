Over the years I've had to roll many of my own Arduino functions to solve some interesting or tedious problems, and I've decided to put all of these solutions into a single, easy-to-use Arduino library. Don't worry - the only flash and RAM space it takes are the functions you actually use! The compiler is smart enough to ignore everything else.

This is a work-in-progress library providing many useful functions! Until it's ready for release, [watch the documentation](http://connor-n.com/kit)!
